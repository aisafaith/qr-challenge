## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned to center div vertically and horizontally.


```css
.flex {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I didn't use other tools like SASS. So I will try to learn them, and next time, I will incorporate them in my processes.

### Useful resources

- freeCodeCamp and w3schools are my go-to resources.
